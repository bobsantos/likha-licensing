# Technology Stack Selection for Enterprise Licensing Platform

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2025-07-29

## Context

We are building a comprehensive enterprise licensing software platform that will serve licensing agencies in managing their contracts, royalties, product approvals, and digital assets. The platform needs to support:

- Multi-tenant SaaS architecture
- Document management (contracts in PDF, DOCX, TXT formats)
- Complex business workflows across multiple domains
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance
- Scalability to handle 10,000+ contracts per tenant
- Integration capabilities with external systems (QuickBooks, SAP, etc.)
- Real-time notifications and alerts
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities

The initial implementation will follow a monolithic architecture with clear module boundaries (Spring Modulith) to enable future microservices migration if needed.

## Decision

We have chosen the following technology stack:

### Backend/API Layer

- **Java 21** with Spring Boot 3.2+
- **Spring Modulith** for modular monolith architecture
- **Spring JDBC** for database operations (instead of Hibernate/JPA)
- **Spring Security** for authentication and authorization
- **Spring WebMVC** for REST API endpoints

### Frontend

- **React 18+** with TypeScript
- **Vite** as build tool and development server
- **Chakra UI** for component library
- **TanStack Table** for advanced data grid functionality
- **Axios** for HTTP client
- **React Router** for client-side routing

### Database & Storage

- **PostgreSQL 15+** as primary database
- **Schema-per-tenant** multi-tenancy approach
- **AWS S3** for document and file storage
- **Redis** for caching and session management (future)

### Infrastructure & Deployment

- **Docker** for containerization
- **AWS Fargate** for serverless container deployment
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** for load balancing
- **AWS RDS** for managed PostgreSQL
- **AWS S3** for object storage

### Development & Operations

- **Docker Compose** for local development environment
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD pipeline
- **AWS CloudWatch** for monitoring and logging

## Rationale

### Backend Technology Choice

**Java 21 + Spring Boot** was chosen over alternatives because:

- **Enterprise Readiness**: Proven at scale in enterprise environments
- **Modern Features**: Java 21 LTS provides Virtual Threads for better concurrency
- **Spring Ecosystem**: Comprehensive framework with excellent modulith support
- **Long-term Support**: Java 21 supported until 2031
- **Team Expertise**: Leveraging existing Java/Spring knowledge

**Spring JDBC over Hibernate/JPA** because:

- **Simplicity**: No ORM complexity or magic behavior
- **Performance**: Direct SQL control and optimization
- **Multi-tenancy**: Easier schema-per-tenant implementation
- **Modulith Compatibility**: Each module has simple, focused queries
- **Debugging**: Clear SQL execution without proxy objects

### Frontend Technology Choice

**React + TypeScript + Vite** was chosen because:

- **Developer Experience**: Fast development with hot reload
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides compile-time error checking
- **Ecosystem**: Vast library ecosystem for enterprise features
- **Monolith Integration**: Builds to static files served by Spring Boot
- **Performance**: Vite provides faster builds than traditional bundlers

**Chakra UI over Material-UI** because:

- **Cost**: No licensing fees for advanced features
- **Developer Experience**: Modern, composable API
- **Customization**: Better theming and customization options
- **TypeScript**: Excellent TypeScript support out of the box

### Database Technology Choice

**PostgreSQL with Schema-per-tenant** because:

- **Data Isolation**: Complete tenant separation at schema level
- **Performance**: Better than row-level security for large datasets
- **JSONB Support**: Flexible metadata storage
- **Full-text Search**: Built-in search capabilities
- **Proven Scalability**: Handles enterprise workloads effectively

### Infrastructure Choice

**AWS + Fargate + Docker** because:

- **Serverless Containers**: No infrastructure management overhead
- **Scalability**: Automatic scaling based on demand
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-per-use pricing model
- **Development Consistency**: Same containers in dev/test/prod
- **Integration Testing**: Easy local infrastructure mocking

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Rapid Development**: Modern tooling enables fast iteration
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end type safety from database to UI
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports growth without major rewrites
- **Cost Effective**: No licensing fees for core technologies
- **Developer Productivity**: Excellent tooling and development experience
- **Enterprise Ready**: All technologies proven in enterprise environments

### Negative

- **Learning Curve**: Team needs familiarity with schema-per-tenant patterns
- **AWS Dependency**: Some vendor lock-in with AWS services
- **Complexity**: Docker adds operational complexity vs simple deployments
- **Memory Usage**: Java applications require more memory than alternatives

### Risks & Mitigation

- **Vendor Lock-in**: Use abstraction layers and standard APIs where possible
- **Scaling Limits**: Monitor performance and plan microservices migration path
- **Security**: Implement comprehensive audit logging and security scanning
- **Cost Management**: Monitor AWS costs and optimize resource usage

## Implementation Notes

### Development Environment Setup

```bash
# Local development stack
docker-compose up  # PostgreSQL + S3Mock + Redis
npm run dev        # Frontend development server
./mvnw spring-boot:run  # Backend application
```

### Deployment Pipeline

1. Build frontend assets with Vite
2. Package Spring Boot JAR with embedded frontend
3. Build Docker image
4. Deploy to AWS Fargate via GitHub Actions

### Module Structure

```
src/main/java/com/licensing/
├── contracts/          # Contract management module
├── royalties/          # Royalty calculation module
├── approvals/          # Product approval module
├── assets/             # Digital asset management module
└── platform/           # Cross-cutting concerns
```

### Multi-tenancy Implementation

- JWT tokens contain tenant identifier
- Spring interceptor sets tenant context
- JDBC operations use `SET search_path TO tenant_schema`
- Each tenant gets isolated PostgreSQL schema
