# Security Scanning Strategy

## Overview

This project uses **Trivy** as the primary vulnerability scanner, replacing OWASP Dependency Check for improved performance and comprehensive security coverage.

## Security Scanning Components

### 1. Trivy Filesystem Scanner
- **Location**: `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`
- **Scope**: Source code, dependencies, configuration files
- **Scanners**: Vulnerabilities, secrets, misconfigurations
- **Severity**: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM
- **Output**: SARIF format uploaded to GitHub Security tab

### 2. Trivy Container Scanner
- **Location**: `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`
- **Scope**: Docker images and container layers
- **Scanners**: OS packages, language dependencies, secrets, configs
- **Severity**: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM
- **Output**: SARIF format uploaded to GitHub Security tab

### 3. NPM Audit
- **Location**: `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Scope**: Frontend Node.js dependencies
- **Threshold**: High severity vulnerabilities
- **Output**: JSON report for analysis

## Why Trivy Over OWASP Dependency Check?

### Performance Benefits
- **No NVD Database Sync**: Eliminates 5-10 minute database download delays
- **No Cache Issues**: Removes complex caching strategies and cache misses
- **Faster Scans**: Typically completes in under 2 minutes vs 5-15 minutes
- **Parallel Processing**: Better resource utilization

### Coverage Improvements
- **Multi-Language**: Supports Java, JavaScript, Python, Go, and more
- **Container Security**: Comprehensive container layer scanning
- **Secret Detection**: Built-in secret scanning capabilities  
- **Misconfiguration Detection**: Infrastructure-as-Code security checks
- **Operating System**: OS package vulnerability detection

### Integration Benefits
- **GitHub Security Tab**: Native SARIF upload integration
- **Better Reporting**: Cleaner, more actionable vulnerability reports
- **Lower Maintenance**: No API key management or rate limiting
- **Consistent Updates**: Regular vulnerability database updates

## Security Coverage Validation

### What Trivy Scans

1. **Java Dependencies** (Maven/JAR files)
   - Direct and transitive dependencies
   - Known vulnerabilities from multiple databases
   - License compliance issues

2. **Node.js Dependencies** (package.json/package-lock.json)
   - NPM package vulnerabilities
   - Complemented by native NPM audit

3. **Container Images**
   - Base image vulnerabilities (Alpine/Ubuntu packages)
   - Application layer security issues
   - Container configuration problems

4. **Source Code**
   - Embedded secrets and credentials
   - Hardcoded sensitive information
   - Configuration misconfigurations

5. **Infrastructure**
   - Dockerfile security best practices
   - Kubernetes YAML configurations
   - CI/CD pipeline security

### Security Thresholds

- **Build Failure**: None (informational only)
- **GitHub Security Alerts**: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM
- **Monitoring**: All vulnerabilities tracked in Security tab
- **Review Process**: Security team reviews findings weekly

## Workflow Integration

### CI Pipeline (`ci.yml`)
- Basic NPM audit for frontend dependencies
- Fast feedback for pull requests
- No container scanning (performance focused)

### Code Quality Pipeline (`code-quality.yml`)
- Comprehensive Trivy filesystem scanning
- Container image security analysis
- Complete security reporting
- SARIF upload to GitHub Security

### Deployment Pipeline (`deploy.yml`)
- Production container scanning before deployment
- Security gate for releases
- Vulnerability tracking for deployed images

## Monitoring and Alerting

### GitHub Security Tab
- Centralized vulnerability dashboard
- Automated issue creation for new vulnerabilities
- Integration with dependency updates (Dependabot)
- Security advisory tracking

### Artifacts and Reports
- `trivy-results.sarif`: Filesystem scan results
- `trivy-image-results.sarif`: Container scan results
- `npm-audit-report.json`: NPM vulnerability report
- `security-scan-summary.md`: Workflow summary

## Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Review security alerts in GitHub Security tab weekly
2. Update dependencies regularly using automated PRs
3. Run `npm audit fix` for frontend vulnerabilities
4. Test security locally with: `trivy fs .`

### For DevOps/Security Team
1. Monitor security trends in the Security tab
2. Configure security policies for critical vulnerabilities
3. Review and approve security-related dependency updates
4. Maintain allow/deny lists for specific vulnerabilities

### For Release Management
1. Check security status before major releases
2. Document any accepted risks in release notes
3. Ensure container images pass security scans
4. Coordinate with security team for critical fixes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **SARIF Upload Failures**: Check file format and GitHub permissions
- **False Positives**: Use Trivy's ignore file (.trivyignore)
- **Scan Timeouts**: Adjust timeout settings in workflow
- **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure all package files are committed

### Performance Optimization
- Use cache strategies for Trivy DB updates
- Skip unnecessary directories (node_modules, .git)
- Run scans in parallel where possible
- Monitor scan duration and optimize as needed

## Migration from OWASP

### Completed Actions
- ✅ Removed OWASP Dependency Check plugin from Maven
- ✅ Disabled OWASP workflows in GitHub Actions
- ✅ Updated scripts to remove OWASP references
- ✅ Enhanced Trivy configuration for comprehensive coverage
- ✅ Improved SARIF reporting and GitHub integration

### Validation Steps
1. Verify no OWASP-related Maven goals in builds
2. Confirm Trivy scans complete successfully
3. Check GitHub Security tab for vulnerability reports
4. Validate NPM audit still functions
5. Test container scanning in deployment pipeline
