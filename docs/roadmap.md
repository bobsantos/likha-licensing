# Likha Licensing Platform Roadmap
*Customer-Driven Production Readiness Strategy*

## Overview

This roadmap implements a customer-validation-first approach to production readiness. We develop Contract Management + Royalty Management locally, demo to customers, and only invest in production infrastructure once we have validated demand with paying customers.

**Core Principle**: No production costs until we have paying customer validation.

---

## Phase Structure

### Phase 1: Local Development Phase (Months 1-2.5)
**Goal**: Build Contract + Royalty Management MVPs entirely in local environment
**Investment**: Development time only, zero production costs
**Environment**: Docker-based local development with PostgreSQL and file storage

### Phase 2: Customer Demo & Validation (Month 2.5-3)
**Goal**: Demo MVPs to prospects and secure first paying customer
**Investment**: Sales effort only
**Environment**: Enhanced local environment for customer demos

### Phase 3: Production Readiness Phase (Month 3-6)
**Trigger**: First paying customer secured
**Goal**: Deploy to production and build remaining modules
**Investment**: AWS infrastructure, monitoring, CDN costs justified by revenue
