## Technical Architecture for MVP

**Keep It Simple:**
- Monolithic Spring Boot application
- Single PostgreSQL database with schema-per-tenant
- React SPA frontend
- AWS Fargate for hosting
- Basic monitoring with CloudWatch

**MVP Tech Debt We Accept:**
- Manual deployment processes
- Basic error handling
- Limited test coverage (focus on critical paths)
- Simple UI without advanced components

**Non-Negotiable Quality:**
- Secure tenant isolation
- Accurate financial calculations
- Reliable document storage
- Data backup and recovery

## Resource Allocation

**Engineering Focus:**
- 70% feature development
- 20% bug fixes and iterations
- 10% infrastructure and deployment

**Product Focus:**
- Customer interviews and onboarding
- Feature prioritization based on feedback
- Documentation and training materials
- Sales support and demos

## Success Metrics

**Technical Metrics:**
- Page load time < 3 seconds
- 99.5% uptime
- Zero data breaches
- Deployment time < 30 minutes

**Business Metrics:**
- 1 paying customer by month 3
- 3-5 paying customers by month 6
- $2,500+ MRR by month 6
- Customer onboarding time < 2 hours

**Product Metrics:**
- Weekly active users per customer
- Contracts uploaded per week
- Feature adoption rates
- Customer satisfaction (NPS)

## Risk Mitigation

**Biggest Risks:**
1. **Over-engineering the MVP** → Stay disciplined on feature scope
2. **First customer churn** → Weekly check-ins and rapid response
3. **Technical debt accumulation** → Address critical issues immediately
4. **Slow customer acquisition** → Start sales conversations in month 1

## Month-by-Month Execution Plan

**Month 1:** Contract Management core (upload, search, metadata)  
**Month 2:** Alerts, basic UI polish, royalty calculation engine  
**Month 3:** First customer launch, royalty reporting, feedback iteration  
**Month 4:** Product approval workflow, customer #2-3 onboarding  
**Month 5:** Digital asset management, system stabilization  
**Month 6:** Polish all modules, scale to 5 customers, plan next phase  

This focused 6-month vision prioritizes speed-to-market with essential features only, allowing us to validate product-market fit quickly while building a foundation for future growth.
