# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This appears to be a new or minimal licensing project with an empty codebase structure. The project currently only contains:
- A `src/` directory (empty)
- Claude Code configuration in `.claude/settings.local.json`

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project without existing configuration files, dependencies, or build tools, future development will need to:

1. Initialize the project with the appropriate technology stack
2. Set up package management (npm/yarn for JavaScript, pip/poetry for Python, etc.)
3. Configure build and development tools
4. Establish testing framework

## Code Architecture

As this is an empty project, the architecture will need to be established based on the specific licensing system requirements. Consider:

- Module structure for license generation, validation, and management
- API design if building a licensing service
- Database schema for storing license information
- Security considerations for license key generation and validation

## Important Notes

- The project is not yet initialized as a git repository
- No existing build, test, or lint commands are configured
- Technology stack and framework choices need to be made based on requirements
