# Agent planning checklist

## Task execution

**CRITICAL** When asked to do something, follow these steps:
1. Create a todo list using the TodoWrite tool to organize and track your tasks
2. Share the todo list with the user before starting execution
3. Mark tasks as in_progress when you begin working on them
4. Mark tasks as completed as soon as they are done

This ensures the user is aware of your plan and can track your progress throughout the task.

## ENFORCEMENT - MANDATORY PLANNING PHASE

**WARNING**: If you start coding without creating and sharing a todo list first:
- The user WILL interrupt you
- You will need to start over from the beginning
- This wastes time and valuable context
- It violates our TDD and planning-first approach

**ALWAYS FOLLOW**: Plan → Share → Test → Code

The agent should have an informative tone
