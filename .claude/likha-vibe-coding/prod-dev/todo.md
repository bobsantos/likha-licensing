  - **‚úÖ RESOLVED:** ContractManagementHealthIndicator implemented with comprehensive schema validation
  - **‚úÖ ADDED:** Spring Boot actuator integration for contract table health checks
  - **‚úÖ ADDED:** Schema existence and accessibility verification with detailed reporting
  - **‚úÖ ADDED:** Row Level Security (RLS) and tenant isolation validation
  - **‚úÖ ADDED:** Performance monitoring with execution timing
  - **‚úÖ ADDED:** Comprehensive unit and integration tests following TDD approach

- [ ] **todo-6:** [HIGH] Verify database accessibility from backend service with contract operations
  - **ü§ù Requires @agent-backend support** for Spring JDBC testing
  - Test basic CRUD operations on contract tables
  - Validate tenant isolation works correctly for contract data
  - Ensure connection stability and error handling

- [ ] **todo-9:** [MEDIUM] Create batch upload session tracking for multi-file upload support
  - Design upload_sessions table for grouping related files
  - Include session status and timestamp tracking
  - Support for partial upload recovery

### Testing & Validation

## üõ† Technical Implementation Notes

### Database Schema Structure:
```sql
-- Contract files table (per tenant schema)
contracts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  tenant_id UUID NOT NULL,
  filename VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  original_filename VARCHAR(255),
  file_size BIGINT,
  mime_type VARCHAR(100),
  s3_bucket VARCHAR(100),
  s3_key VARCHAR(500),
  checksum VARCHAR(64),
  upload_session_id UUID,
  status VARCHAR(50),
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
)

-- Upload sessions table (per tenant schema)
upload_sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  tenant_id UUID NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(50),
  total_files INTEGER,
  completed_files INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

### Key Integration Points:
- **S3 Integration:** File paths and metadata for MinIO/S3 storage
- **Multi-tenant:** Proper tenant isolation for contract data
- **Spring Boot:** Health checks and connection validation
- **Future APIs:** Schema ready for file upload and management endpoints
