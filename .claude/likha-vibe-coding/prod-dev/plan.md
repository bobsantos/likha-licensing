# US-001: Tenant Schema Provisioning - Delivery Plan

## Executive Summary

- **Current Status**: Re-evaluated with deferred deployment strategy (all tasks pending)
- **Target User Story**: US-001 - Tenant Schema Provisioning
- **Key Deliverables**: Demo-ready MVP feature with multi-tenant schema provisioning, local development focus
- **Timeline**: 5 days (MVP feature for customer demo)
- **Cost-Saving Strategy**: Production deployment deferred until customer demo validates market fit

## Current Status Assessment

- **User Story**: US-001 - Tenant Schema Provisioning
- **Story Status**: pending
- **Total Tasks**: 14
- **Completed Tasks**: 0
- **Pending Tasks**: 14
- **Identified Blockers**: None currently, but Docker environment (T010) is critical for all development

## Task Prioritization Decision

After collaborative analysis between Infrastructure, Backend, and Design agents, the following prioritization has been agreed upon:

### Day 1 Priority Tasks (Parallel Execution)

1. **US-001-T010: Docker Development Environment Setup** (Infrastructure) - **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
   - Rationale: Blocks ALL development work across teams
   - Zero dependencies, enables consistent development workflow
   - Critical for team velocity from Day 1

2. **US-001-T013: Provisioning Wizard Design Specifications** (Design)
   - Rationale: Zero dependencies, enables frontend development
   - Quick delivery (0.5 days) unblocks multiple frontend tasks
   - Can proceed in parallel without resource competition

3. **US-001-T001: Core Schema Provisioning Service** (Backend)
   - Rationale: Foundational service for entire feature
   - Can start with local PostgreSQL while T008 progresses
   - Critical path dependency for all other backend tasks

4. **US-001-T008: PostgreSQL Multi-Tenant Database Setup - Local Development** (Infrastructure)
   - Rationale: Required for local development and demo preparation
   - Enables feature validation against 2-minute SLA in local environment
   - **Revised Scope**: Local Docker setup only, production deployment deferred

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Docker Configuration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Use proven Docker Compose patterns
   - Contingency: Provide fallback local setup instructions

2. **Database Performance**
   - Mitigation: Early performance testing on Day 2
   - Contingency: Connection pool tuning, query optimization

3. **Frontend-Backend Integration**
   - Mitigation: API contract definition on Day 2
   - Contingency: Mock API responses for frontend development

4. **AWS Provisioning Delays**
   - Mitigation: Terraform automation from Day 1
   - Contingency: Local testing environment fallback

### Critical Path Protection
- T010 (Docker) and T001 (Schema Service) are highest priority
- Daily standup to identify blockers early
- Parallel execution maximizes resource utilization
- MVP scope strictly enforced to prevent feature creep

## Revised Prioritization Strategy: Customer Demo First

The **deferred deployment approach** fundamentally shifts our strategy from "production-ready first" to "customer validation first." This revision prioritizes T010 (Docker Environment) and T001 (Backend Core) while deferring production infrastructure until customer demo success validates market demand.

**Key Strategic Changes:**

1. **Cost-Optimized Development**: Local development focus eliminates premature AWS infrastructure costs (~$250-500/month)
2. **Risk-Mitigated Investment**: Production deployment only after customer validation confirms market fit
3. **Demo-Driven Validation**: Complete MVP feature ready for customer demonstration in 5 days
4. **Conditional Scaling**: Production infrastructure activated only upon successful customer interest

**Implementation Benefits:**

1. Unblocks all teams for MVP feature development by end of Day 1
2. Maintains critical path efficiency while eliminating deployment complexity
3. Enables parallel development streams focused on customer-demo-ready features
4. Delivers complete MVP feature within 5 days for customer validation
5. Defers infrastructure investment until customer demand is proven

**Post-Demo Acceleration**: Upon successful customer demo, production deployment can be completed in 2-3 additional days using the established foundation.

This **customer demo-first strategy** ensures we build the right feature completely before investing in production infrastructure, maximizing our learning while minimizing upfront costs.
