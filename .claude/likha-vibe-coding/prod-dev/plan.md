## 4. Task Prioritization

### **Critical Path Tasks** (must complete first)
- **Day 1-2.5**: Infrastructure Docker environment with MinIO setup
- **Day 1-3**: Design wireframes and specifications
- **Day 3**: Backend API contract with S3 integration patterns
- **Day 2-3**: Security requirements including S3 access control

### **Parallel Development Opportunities**
- Design work (Days 1-3) runs parallel to infrastructure
- Security requirements (Days 2-3) parallel to other work
- MinIO setup (Day 1-2) parallel to database configuration

### **MVP Approach with S3** (simplified but production-ready)
- MinIO for S3-compatible storage (no code changes for production)
- S3 multipart uploads for progress tracking
- S3 SDK for standardized file operations
- Basic S3 bucket security patterns

## 5. Team Focus Areas

### **Backend Team**
- **Primary Deliverables**: S3-integrated upload API, file validation, storage service, progress tracking
- **Key Tasks**: 
  - Day 3: API contract with S3 SDK integration
  - Day 4-5: S3 storage service implementation
  - Week 2, Day 1-2: Multipart upload progress tracking

### **Frontend Team**
- **Primary Deliverables**: Upload component, progress UI, error handling, S3 upload integration
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Day 4-5: Multi-file upload component with drag-drop
  - Week 2, Day 1: Progress tracking via S3 multipart
  - Week 2, Day 2-3: Complete S3 upload integration

### **Infrastructure Team**
- **Primary Deliverables**: Docker environment with MinIO, database setup, S3 storage, documentation
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Day 1-2: Docker environment with MinIO S3 service
  - Day 2-2.5: S3 bucket configuration and access setup
  - Day 3: Integration validation and S3 documentation

### **Design Team**
- **Primary Deliverables**: User journey, wireframes, visual specifications, responsive design
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Day 1: Upload flow and interface wireframes
  - Day 2: Progress tracking and error state designs
  - Day 3: Mobile responsive specifications

### **Security Team**
- **Security Requirements**: S3 access control, file upload validation, API security
- **Compliance Checks**: S3 bucket policies, IAM patterns, security testing

## 6. Success Metrics & Milestones

### **Week 1 Goals**
- Day 2.5: Infrastructure with MinIO S3 storage complete
- Day 3: Design specs delivered, S3-integrated API contracts defined
- Day 5: Core backend S3 upload functionality working

### **Week 2 Goals**
- Day 2: Frontend-backend S3 integration functional
- Day 4: Performance testing passed (20 concurrent S3 uploads)
- Day 5: Production-ready with S3 configuration documented

### **Definition of Done**
- [ ] Upload 2-20 PDF files via S3-compatible storage
- [ ] S3 multipart upload progress tracking
- [ ] File validation with S3 metadata
- [ ] Error handling with S3 retry logic
- [ ] Mobile responsive interface
- [ ] S3 security patterns implemented
- [ ] Performance tested with concurrent S3 uploads
- [ ] Production S3 migration documentation

## 7. Risk Mitigation

### **MinIO Integration Complexity**
- **Risk**: Additional 0.5 days for S3 setup might cascade
- **Mitigation**: Run MinIO setup parallel to database configuration
- **Benefit**: Eliminates future S3 migration risks entirely

### **S3 SDK Learning Curve**
- **Risk**: Team unfamiliar with AWS S3 SDK patterns
- **Mitigation**: Use well-documented Spring Boot S3 starters
- **Contingency**: Infrastructure team provides S3 code examples

### **Concurrent S3 Upload Performance**
- **Risk**: S3 multipart complexity for 20 uploads
- **Mitigation**: MinIO allows realistic performance testing
- **Benefit**: Production-identical performance validation

### **S3 Security Configuration**
- **Risk**: Incorrect S3 bucket policies or access control
- **Mitigation**: Security team defines S3 patterns early (Day 2-3)
- **Benefit**: Production-ready security from Day 1

## 8. Production Readiness Benefits

### **Why MinIO in MVP**
- **Zero Code Changes**: Development code works identically in production AWS S3
- **Realistic Testing**: Actual S3 behavior for uploads, downloads, errors
- **Advanced Features**: Multipart uploads, metadata, versioning available
- **Security Patterns**: IAM and bucket policies testable locally
- **Performance Validation**: Concurrent upload behavior matches production

### **Eliminated Future Work**
- No S3 migration story needed
- No file storage refactoring
- No security pattern changes
- No API contract modifications
- No testing environment differences

## Delivery Confidence

**Overall Assessment**: HIGH - MinIO addition provides production-ready solution with minimal timeline impact  
**Critical Success Factors**:
- Infrastructure delivers MinIO setup by Day 2.5
- Backend embraces S3 SDK patterns from start
- Teams leverage S3 features vs. building custom solutions

**Timeline Adjustment**: Infrastructure +0.5 days, Backend +0.5 days (absorbed within 2-week sprint)  
**Next Action**: Begin infrastructure setup with MinIO and design work in parallel on Day 1
