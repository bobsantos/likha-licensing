# US-001: Tenant Schema Provisioning - Delivery Plan

## Executive Summary

- **Current Status**: New planning (all tasks pending)
- **Target User Story**: US-001 - Tenant Schema Provisioning
- **Key Deliverables**: Multi-tenant schema provisioning with <2 minute SLA, security isolation, audit logging
- **Timeline**: 5 days (MVP delivery approach)

## Current Status Assessment

- **User Story**: US-001 - Tenant Schema Provisioning
- **Story Status**: pending
- **Total Tasks**: 14
- **Completed Tasks**: 0
- **Pending Tasks**: 14
- **Identified Blockers**: None currently, but Docker environment (T010) is critical for all development

## Task Prioritization Decision

After collaborative analysis between Infrastructure, Backend, and Design agents, the following prioritization has been agreed upon:

### Day 1 Priority Tasks (Parallel Execution)

1. **US-001-T010: Docker Development Environment Setup** (Infrastructure) - **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
   - Rationale: Blocks ALL development work across teams
   - Zero dependencies, enables consistent development workflow
   - Critical for team velocity from Day 1

2. **US-001-T013: Provisioning Wizard Design Specifications** (Design)
   - Rationale: Zero dependencies, enables frontend development
   - Quick delivery (0.5 days) unblocks multiple frontend tasks
   - Can proceed in parallel without resource competition

3. **US-001-T001: Core Schema Provisioning Service** (Backend)
   - Rationale: Foundational service for entire feature
   - Can start with local PostgreSQL while T008 progresses
   - Critical path dependency for all other backend tasks

4. **US-001-T008: PostgreSQL Multi-Tenant Database Setup** (Infrastructure)
   - Rationale: Required for production-ready backend integration
   - Enables performance testing against 2-minute SLA
   - Can proceed in parallel with initial backend development

## Success Metrics & Milestones

### Week 1 Goals
- **Day 2 Checkpoint**: Development environment operational, core services started
- **Day 3 Checkpoint**: APIs functional, frontend development in progress
- **Day 5 Checkpoint**: MVP feature complete, ready for testing

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Schema creation completes in <2 minutes
- [ ] Zero data leakage verified through isolation testing
- [ ] Automated rollback successfully cleans up failures
- [ ] Comprehensive audit trail with retrieval capability
- [ ] All APIs respond within 200ms SLA
- [ ] Frontend wizard completes full workflow
- [ ] Monitoring alerts trigger correctly
- [ ] Deployment pipeline executes successfully

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Docker Configuration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Use proven Docker Compose patterns
   - Contingency: Provide fallback local setup instructions

2. **Database Performance**
   - Mitigation: Early performance testing on Day 2
   - Contingency: Connection pool tuning, query optimization

3. **Frontend-Backend Integration**
   - Mitigation: API contract definition on Day 2
   - Contingency: Mock API responses for frontend development

4. **AWS Provisioning Delays**
   - Mitigation: Terraform automation from Day 1
   - Contingency: Local testing environment fallback

### Critical Path Protection
- T010 (Docker) and T001 (Schema Service) are highest priority
- Daily standup to identify blockers early
- Parallel execution maximizes resource utilization
- MVP scope strictly enforced to prevent feature creep

## Prioritization Rationale Summary

The collaborative decision to prioritize T010 (Docker Environment) reflects its role as a universal enabler for all teams. Starting T013 (Design) and T001 (Backend) in parallel maximizes team utilization while T008 (Database) provides the production foundation. This approach:

1. Unblocks all teams by end of Day 1
2. Maintains critical path efficiency
3. Enables parallel development streams
4. Focuses on MVP delivery within 5 days
5. Defers non-essential features to future iterations

This plan provides clear guidance for all teams while maintaining flexibility to adjust based on daily progress reviews.
