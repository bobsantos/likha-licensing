## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Start with CM-0001 and CM-0002** - Foundation stories that unblock all others
2. **Coordinate @agent-backend and @agent-infra** - Database schema and file storage setup
3. **Begin @agent-frontend planning** - Upload and metadata UI wireframes
4. **Establish testing strategy** - Automated testing for file upload and search

### Development Approach
1. **Parallel development** where dependencies allow (frontend/backend teams)
2. **Integration testing** after each phase completion
3. **Customer demo preparation** during Week 3-4 development
4. **Performance optimization** throughout, not just at the end

### Scope Management  
1. **Hold firm on P0 boundaries** - No P1/P2 features during MVP
2. **Document P1/P2 features** for post-MVP roadmap communication
3. **Monitor development velocity** - Adjust scope if timeline pressure emerges
4. **Prepare scope reduction plan** - Identify which P0 features could be simplified

---

**Next Steps**: Coordinate with technical teams to validate implementation estimates and refine technical dependencies. Begin development with CM-0001 and CM-0002 as foundation stories.

**Document Status**: Complete  
**Review Required**: Technical team validation of implementation estimates  
**Update Schedule**: Weekly during MVP development phase
