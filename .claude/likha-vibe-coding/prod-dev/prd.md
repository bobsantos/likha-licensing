## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Overview

#### Application Architecture
The multi-tenant licensing platform will be built as a modular monolith using Spring Modulith principles to maintain clear boundaries between functional domains:

- **Shared Infrastructure Module**: Common configuration, security, and tenant context management
- **Tenant Management Module**: Tenant lifecycle operations and provisioning
- **Licensing Module**: Core business logic for licensing agreements and operations
- **Audit Module**: Cross-cutting concerns for compliance and audit logging

**Architectural Principles:**
- Clear module boundaries with no circular dependencies
- Tenant context propagation throughout request lifecycle
- Centralized security and configuration management
- Separation of concerns between business logic and infrastructure

#### Multi-tenant Data Access Strategy
**Schema-per-Tenant Approach**: Each tenant will have an isolated database schema within a shared PostgreSQL instance, providing strong data isolation while maintaining operational efficiency.

**Tenant Context Management**: Application will use thread-local tenant context to route database operations to the correct schema, extracted from JWT tokens during request processing.

**Connection Pooling**: HikariCP will manage database connections with tenant-aware routing to optimize resource utilization across multiple schemas.

#### Security Architecture
**JWT-based Authentication**: Tenant context will be embedded in JWT tokens along with user roles and permissions, enabling secure multi-tenant request routing.

**Spring Security Integration**: Custom filters will extract tenant context from JWT tokens and enforce tenant-scoped authorization rules.

**Data Isolation**: Database-level schema isolation combined with application-level tenant context validation ensures zero cross-tenant data access.
