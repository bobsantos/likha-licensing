# Contract Management MVP - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

### Product Vision and Objectives

The Contract Management MVP establishes the foundational module of the Likha Licensing Platform, targeting small-to-medium licensing agencies (50-500 contracts) who currently struggle with disorganized contract storage and inefficient retrieval processes. This MVP delivers core contract organization and search capabilities while establishing the technical foundation for future royalty management integration.

**Primary Objectives:**
