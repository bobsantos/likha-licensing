## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **Concurrent Upload Performance**
   - **Risk**: System performance with 20 simultaneous uploads
   - **Mitigation**: Load testing with realistic file sizes
   - **Contingency**: Reduce max concurrent uploads to 10

2. **File Storage Reliability**
   - **Risk**: File corruption or loss during upload
   - **Mitigation**: Checksum validation and atomic operations
   - **Contingency**: Simple retry mechanism

3. **Frontend Progress Tracking Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Complex progress tracking implementation
   - **Mitigation**: Use proven libraries (React Dropzone, Axios progress)
   - **Contingency**: Simplified progress indication

### Medium-Risk Items
1. **Mobile Upload Experience**
   - **Risk**: Poor mobile file selection experience
   - **Mitigation**: Progressive enhancement approach
   - **Contingency**: Desktop-first, mobile optimization later

2. **Large File Upload Timeouts**
   - **Risk**: Network timeouts for large files
   - **Mitigation**: Chunked upload strategy
   - **Contingency**: Reduce max file size to 5MB
