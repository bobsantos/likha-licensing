### Alerting Strategy
- **Tiered alerting** (P0 critical, P1 high, P2 medium) with escalation policies
- **Context-rich alerts** with runbooks and resolution guidance
- **Alert fatigue prevention** with intelligent noise reduction
- **On-call rotation** management with fair distribution
- **Post-incident analysis** with blameless retrospectives

## Security & Compliance

### Shift-Left Security
- **Security scanning** in IDE with plugins and pre-commit hooks
- **Dependency vulnerability management** with automated updates
- **Secret scanning** to prevent credential exposure
- **Infrastructure security** with AWS Security Hub and Config

- **Audit logging** with immutable trails and compliance reporting
- **Identity and Access Management** (IAM) with role-based permissions
- **Regular access reviews** with automated compliance checks

## Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity

### Backup Strategy
- **Automated database backups** with point-in-time recovery
- **Cross-region replication** for disaster recovery
- **Application data backup** with S3 versioning and lifecycle policies
- **Configuration backup** with IaC state and parameter snapshots
- **Recovery testing** with regular disaster recovery drills

### High Availability
- **Multi-AZ deployment** for database and application layers
- **Auto-scaling** with predictive scaling policies
- **Circuit breakers** and retry logic for resilience
- **Graceful degradation** with fallback mechanisms
- **Health checks** at multiple levels (load balancer, application, database)

## Development Workflow Integration

### Git Workflow
- **Feature branch strategy** with pull request reviews
- **Automated branch protection** with required status checks
