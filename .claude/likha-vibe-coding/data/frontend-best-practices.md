# Frontend Development Best Practices & Standards

## React Architecture & Component Design

### Component Architecture
- **Functional components** with hooks for all new development
- **Custom hooks** for reusable logic and state management
- **Component composition** over inheritance for flexibility
- **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)** for cross-cutting concerns
- **Render props pattern** for complex state sharing scenarios

### Component Organization
- **Feature-based structure** organizing by business domain/feature
- **Atomic design principles** (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages)
- **Single Responsibility Principle** - one component, one purpose
- **Container/Presentation** separation for business logic isolation
- **Barrel exports** (index.ts) for clean import statements

### State Management
- **React Context + useReducer** for global state management
- **Local state** with useState for component-specific data
- **Server state** with React Query/SWR for API data caching
- **Form state** with React Hook Form for optimal performance
- **URL state** with React Router for shareable application state

## TypeScript Integration & Type Safety

### TypeScript Configuration
- **Strict mode** enabled with comprehensive type checking
- **Path mapping** for clean imports and module resolution
- **Declaration files** for third-party libraries without types
- **Generic types** for reusable component and hook patterns
- **Utility types** (Pick, Omit, Partial) for type transformations

### Type Definitions
- **Interface definitions** for props, state, and API responses
- **Enum usage** for constants and configuration values
- **Union types** for flexible but constrained value sets
- **Type guards** for runtime type safety and validation
- **Branded types** for domain-specific type safety

### Advanced TypeScript Patterns
- **Conditional types** for complex type relationships
- **Mapped types** for dynamic type generation
