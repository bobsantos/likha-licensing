# Test Driven Development Best Practices

## Core Principles

**Red-Green-Refactor**: The fundamental TDD cycle where you write a failing test, make it pass with minimal code, then refactor to improve the design while keeping tests green.

**Test First**: Always write tests before implementation code. This ensures you think about the API and behavior before diving into implementation details.

**Small Steps**: Take the smallest possible steps to make tests pass. This keeps you focused and prevents over-engineering.

**Continuous Refactoring**: After each test passes, improve code structure. The safety net of tests allows confident refactoring.

## Test Writing Guidelines

**Single Responsibility**: Each test should verify one specific behavior. This makes tests easier to understand and debug when they fail.

**Descriptive Names**: Test names should clearly describe what is being tested. A good pattern is: `test_methodName_scenario_expectedResult()`.

**Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure tests with clear sections:
- Arrange: Set up test data and conditions
- Act: Execute the code being tested
- Assert: Verify the expected outcome

**Independent Tests**: Tests should not depend on each other's state or execution order. Each test should set up its own data and clean up after itself.

## Test Coverage Strategies

**Happy Path**: Start by testing expected behavior with valid inputs. This establishes the core functionality.

**Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and limits. Consider empty collections, null values, maximum/minimum values.

**Error Conditions**: Test invalid inputs and exception scenarios. Ensure your code fails gracefully.

**Business Rules**: Verify all domain constraints and invariants. These tests document important business logic.

## Implementation Approach

**Minimal Implementation**: Write only enough code to make the current test pass. Resist the urge to add functionality that isn't required by a test.

**Avoid Over-Engineering**: Don't implement features until tests require them. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) applies strongly in TDD.

**Incremental Development**: Add functionality one test at a time. This creates a clear development rhythm and progress tracking.

**Refactor Regularly**: Clean up code after each successful test. Look for duplication, unclear names, and design improvements.

## Maintaining Test Quality

**Fast Execution**: Tests should run quickly to enable frequent execution. Mock external dependencies and use in-memory databases when possible.

**Deterministic Results**: Tests should have consistent, predictable results. Avoid dependencies on system time, random values, or external state.

**Maintainable Tests**: Tests should be easy to understand and modify. Apply the same code quality standards to tests as production code.

**Proper Isolation**: Tests should not have external dependencies when possible. Use mocks, stubs, and fakes to isolate the unit being tested.

## Optimizing the Feedback Loop

**Frequent Test Runs**: Run tests continuously during development. Use watch mode or automatic test runners.

**Clear Failure Messages**: When tests fail, they should clearly indicate what went wrong. Use descriptive assertions and custom error messages.

**Quick Fixes**: Address failing tests immediately. Don't let broken tests accumulate.

**Test Suite Health**: Keep all tests passing at all times. A broken test suite loses its value as a safety net.

## Integration with Development Workflow

**Version Control**: Commit tests and implementation code together. This maintains the connection between tests and the code they verify.

**Code Reviews**: Include test quality in the review process. Tests are code too and deserve the same scrutiny.

**Living Documentation**: Tests serve as executable documentation of system behavior. Well-written tests explain how the code should work.

**Regression Prevention**: Tests protect against future breaking changes. They give confidence when refactoring or adding new features.
